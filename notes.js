// HAZEL THE HEALTH NUT
// Your gal pal Hazel is ravenously hungry! Feed her her favorite healthy snacks before she gets hangry!
// But watch out for the junk food, she's super healthy and gets....gassy.

// MVP:
// - functional game flow where foods fall; bad foods are totaled into junk-o-meter; good foods add to total score
// - when clicked on, foods give respective scores
// - win - set score (25,000) /timed (60 seconds)
// - lose - junk-o-meter overflows (score? how is this totaled?)

// Reach:
// - effects when both types of foods are clicked on
// - audio
// - cohesive styling
// - staus boxes that slide in and out of sight when triggered
// - high score board (local JS storage)
// - restart option

// Objective:
// - Reach 5,000 before time runs out!
// - Beware of the junk! Click on too much junk food and Hazel gets sick (measured by junk-o-meter)
// - Speed increases every 1,000 points, so keep an eye on  your score bar

// Technical Requirements

// Your app must:

// Render the game in the browser
// Design and implement logic for winning & visually display whether the user wins or loses
// Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
// Use the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
// Use jQuery for DOM manipulation
// Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it

// Necessary Deliverables:

// A working game, built by you, hosted on the internet
// A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game in the URL section, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
// You will want to create a git repository on your local machine in a different directory and OUTSIDE of the repo for this class.
// A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
